File to image utility

---
## Idea
Right now (version 0.1.0) can only converts text to image and back again, but it contains the very simple algorithm
that allow encode files in the future. I want to realize the system like "Path to Image", what about store and share your 
projects in images? Sounds interesting. Ok go...

## How to use?
### Installation: 
`yarn global add f2i` or `npm install -g f2i`.

### Encode and decode
Run `f2i` in the terminal and use UI application. Cli version right now in progress.
